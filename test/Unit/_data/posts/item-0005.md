### Synopsis

In this item, I have a fireside chat with Yitzchok Willroth, the one and only [coderabbi](https://twitter.com/@coderabbi), about a his [Wisdom as a Service World Tour](http://wisdomworldtour.com/).

We talk about what it's like to run the tour, the time involved, the energy required, and how it's been received. We also talk about the value of human skills (otherwise known as soft skills), the value of getting up and sharing your knowledge with the community, via public speaking, **and much, much more**.
